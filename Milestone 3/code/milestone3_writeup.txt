Milestone 3 Write-Up
Spencer Reith and Jackson Easley

Task 1: Deploy a functional Cloud environment for your example organization
Following your plan from Milestone 2 - deploy the AWS systems required for your project

Document on your Project Site the steps required to deploy the systems - with labeled screenshots
SUBMIT: Link to the deployment steps and screenshots on your Project Site  

Task 2: Test the Functionality of your Test Environment
Depending on the needs of your chosen topic - test that the systems are functioning as required.  This could include:
Validating neccessary services are running (e.g. web services, file sharing...)
Validating proper network access (e.g. can systems talk to each other if needed, can they access the Internet if needed...)
Validating proper authentication (e.g. can necessary users access the systems)

On your project site, create a page/section that documents your testing and validation

SUBMIT: Link to the testing details on your project site
